			Welcome to Walker Blaster. In this game you will controller the blue colored square and are
			tasked with killing all the random walker enemies that are colored in green. There are walls all around
			you which are colored in white. This is a turn based game where you can only move inside a predetermined 
			area which is indicated by the white circle around you whenever it is your turn. You will move around the map
			shooting any green enemies you see along the way. There are many walkers in your path, are you up for the challenge?
