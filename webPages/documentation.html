                What went right:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to create a turn based game which only allowed
                        the player to move during their turn. We created this by having the player's 
                        turn end when they shot a bullet or they clicked end turn button.
                        Also we had to create a time function that would count the duration
                        of the random walker's turn in seconds. This allowed for distinct
                        turn cycles between the player and enemies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to game world to be bigger than the canvas. We did this by
                        having the player stay in the center of the screen and everything around
                        them move instead. This allowed for a feel that the player was still moving
                        even though they were not. Lastly, this allowed us to extend beyond the 
                        canvas and create move objects outside this zone that the player could still 
                        interact with.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                What went wrong:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The early developmental process for this project did not start off on a great footing.
                        We did not know exactly what we wanted to do for this project and as a group we were not
                        always on the right page about what the game should be. After we had to rethink the game
                        we had similar ideas and finally construction of the game could move forward. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had some issues with the collisions with everything after we tried to create a one function
                        method for collision with the walls. To do this we had to redo how the walkers were being drawn
                        so they also fit the confinds of this method. This created errors with collision with the player
                        when checking this on the enemies turn. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Features we wanted to add:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to create a way to collect powerups on the map that let you upgrade you gun
                        for a calculated amount of shots. We wanted to have certain powerups such as shooting 3
                        bullets in a cone or being able to shoot multiple times in a turn. These would have allowed
                        to add more interactivity to the game for players as they picked up powerups.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also wanted to create phylotaxis whenever an enemy died. They would start out at the origin of
                        where the bullet hit the enemy. This would have added some color and created the game a bit more 
                        interesting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to add assets to the game as right now we only have square blocks to represent our game
                        pieces. This would have added more flavor to our game and would have created a better theme as
                        everything would represent something instead of a square.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

        <div id= "Non-CourseResources">
            <h2>Non-Course Resources</h2>
            <section>
                We did use some outside class resources, we repurposed some old code that was used on a project in IGME 235.
                This code was for storing the keyboard inputs to get the player to move around the screen. The other code that
                we used that we got help on was a section on mouse clicking but, we took that from one of the canvas homework
                assignments.
            </section>
        </div>
        <div id= "Grade">
            <h2>Grade</h2>
            <section>
                I believe we deserve a 94% as even though a lot doesn't display on the screen, we put a lot of work into the
                backend of the game. With the turns it took alot of coding to figure out how each turn would be played out.
                Also we had to do a lot of collision detection between the walls, player, and enemies. We tried to create
                the closest thing to a turn based game and we think we created a very similar design.
